# Overview
My thesis was a piece of biomedical research at the University of Queensland. I investigated the relationship between Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA), and Hypertension using Machine Learning. My specific goal was to determine if there were any characteristics of OSA that were highly associated with hypertension, that previous research methods had not yet uncovered. At the end of the project, I was left with a newfound knowledge of OSA, working with large datasets, and applying Machine Learning algorithms to extract useful information from data.
